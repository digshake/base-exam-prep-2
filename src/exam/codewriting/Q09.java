	We wish to write a method that counts the number of digits in an int. For example:

		numDigits(1000) would return 4

	Your task is to construct a recursive implementation of numDigits which has been started for you below.
	You do not need a helper method to do this, but you can use one if you wish. No credit will be given for
	this problem if a loop is used at any point.
